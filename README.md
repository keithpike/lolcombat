LOLCombat is a League of Legends combat simulator.

This was a project to learn Angular and make something cool in the process.

Choose two champions to battle head to head, fill their loadouts and see the action unfold (it's a chart)!
No one likes to fill in calculators with numbers to see DPS calculations, why not use an interface similar to the game you know and love?

Bottom line is it simulates a battle between two champions and gives informational readouts about the events that lead to that point.
Some interesting stat information is intended to be displayed but only after the core functionality is completely implemented.
